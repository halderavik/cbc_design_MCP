# CBC Design MCP - Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with the CBC Design MCP in 5 minutes!

## üöÄ 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Test Connection
```
"Check if the CBC Design MCP is working by running a health check"
```

### Step 2: Generate Your First Design
```
"Generate a simple CBC design for coffee with:
- Brand: Starbucks, Dunkin, Local Coffee Shop
- Price: $3, $4, $5
- Size: Small, Medium, Large

Use random algorithm for 20 respondents"
```

### Step 3: Export Your Design
```
"Export the design to CSV format and save it as 'coffee_design.csv'"
```

**That's it!** You now have a working CBC design ready for your survey.

## üìã Most Common Use Cases

### 1. Product Pricing Study
```
"Generate a CBC design for [your product] with:
- Brand: [Brand A], [Brand B], [Brand C]
- Price: $[X], $[Y], $[Z]
- Features: [Feature 1], [Feature 2], [Feature 3]

Use balanced algorithm for 100 respondents"
```

### 2. Service Optimization
```
"Create a CBC design for [your service] with:
- Service Level: Basic, Standard, Premium
- Price: $[X], $[Y], $[Z]
- Delivery: [Option 1], [Option 2], [Option 3]

Use orthogonal arrays for 150 respondents"
```

### 3. Market Research
```
"Generate a CBC design for [your category] with:
- [Attribute 1]: [Level 1], [Level 2], [Level 3]
- [Attribute 2]: [Level 1], [Level 2], [Level 3]
- [Attribute 3]: [Level 1], [Level 2], [Level 3]

Let the system suggest optimal sample size"
```

## üîß Essential Commands

### Generate Design
```
"Generate a CBC design for [product] with [attributes] using [algorithm] for [X] respondents"
```

### Optimize Parameters
```
"Optimize study parameters for [X] attributes with [Y] levels each"
```

### Export Design
```
"Export the design to [CSV/JSON/Qualtrics] format and save as '[filename]'"
```

### Check Quality
```
"Show me the design efficiency metrics for the last generated design"
```

## üìù Template Examples

### E-commerce Product
```
"Generate a CBC design for [product name] with:
- Brand: [Brand 1], [Brand 2], [Brand 3]
- Price: $[Price 1], $[Price 2], $[Price 3]
- Features: [Feature 1], [Feature 2], [Feature 3]
- Rating: [Rating 1], [Rating 2], [Rating 3]

Use balanced algorithm for 200 respondents"
```

### Service Business
```
"Create a CBC design for [service name] with:
- Service Level: Basic, Standard, Premium
- Price: $[Price 1], $[Price 2], $[Price 3]
- Delivery: [Option 1], [Option 2], [Option 3]
- Support: [Support 1], [Support 2], [Support 3]

Use orthogonal arrays for 250 respondents"
```

### Software Product
```
"Generate a CBC design for [software name] with:
- Plan: [Plan 1], [Plan 2], [Plan 3]
- Price: $[Price 1], $[Price 2], $[Price 3]
- Features: [Feature 1], [Feature 2], [Feature 3]
- Support: [Support 1], [Support 2], [Support 3]

Use D-optimal algorithm for 300 respondents"
```

## ‚ö° Quick Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with 3-4 attributes and 2-3 levels each
2. **Use Balanced**: The balanced algorithm works well for most studies
3. **Check Quality**: Always review design efficiency metrics
4. **Export Early**: Save your designs as soon as they're generated
5. **Test First**: Try a small sample size before your full study

## üÜò Common Issues & Solutions

### "Design generation failed"
**Solution**: Try fewer attributes or use the random algorithm

### "Sample size too small"
**Solution**: Use the optimization tool to get recommendations

### "Export failed"
**Solution**: Make sure you've generated a design first

### "System not responding"
**Solution**: Run a health check to verify the MCP is working

## üìö Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics:

1. **Read the full User Guide** (`docs/user_guide.md`)
2. **Try advanced examples** (`docs/example_prompts.md`)
3. **Learn about optimization** (use the optimize_parameters tool)
4. **Explore different algorithms** (try D-optimal for high-quality studies)
5. **Add constraints** (prevent unrealistic combinations)

## üéâ You're Ready!

You now have everything you need to create professional CBC designs. Start with the simple examples above, then gradually explore more advanced features as you become comfortable with the system.

**Happy designing!** üöÄ
